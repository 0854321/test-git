# Outline: minimal + balanced

## Image 1 - Cover (sparse)
**Layout:** Ultra-clean typography with generous white space

**Text:**
- Main: "AI Tools for Productivity"
- Subtitle: "5 essentials for 2024"

**Visual Concept:**
Sophisticated, elegant layout. Clean sans-serif typography. Subtle color palette (black, white, one accent). Lots of breathing room. One small accent element (line, dot, or simple shape). Professional, premium feel.

## Image 2 - Content (balanced)
**Layout:** Clean 2-column grid for first 3 tools

**Text:**
- Header: "Essential Tools"
- "Claude" - "Writing & ideation"
- "Notion" - "Organization & docs"
- "Figma" - "Design with AI"

**Visual Concept:**
Three cards in balanced layout. Each card: tool name (bold), use case (light). Subtle icons or none at all - let typography speak. Soft gray backgrounds with one accent color. Consistent spacing and alignment. Refined, understated.

## Image 3 - Content (balanced)
**Layout:** Clean 2-item layout for remaining tools

**Text:**
- Header: "Dev & Creative"
- "GitHub Copilot" - "Code assistant"
- "Midjourney" - "AI art generation"

**Visual Concept:**
Two larger cards with more detail per item. Same design language as image 2. Could include one key benefit or stat per tool. Maintains visual consistency with series. Clean borders or subtle shadows.

---

## Image 4 - Ending (sparse)
**Layout:** Minimal CTA with subtle prompt

**Text:**
- Main: "Build your toolkit"
- Subtitle: "Start with one, grow from there"

**Visual Concept:**
Quiet, confident closing. Small centered text. No overwhelming graphics. Maybe a simple progress element or underscore. Encouraging without being pushy. Same accent color used throughout. Professional, considered tone.
